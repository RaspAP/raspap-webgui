## Quick start
RaspAP gives you two different ways to get up and running quickly. The simplest and recommended approach is to use a custom Raspberry Pi OS image with RaspAP preinstalled. This option eliminates guesswork and gives you a base upon which to build. Alternatively, you may execute the Quick installer on an existing [compatible OS](https://docs.raspap.com/#compatible-operating-systems).

### Pre-built image
Custom Raspberry Pi OS Lite images with the latest RaspAP are available for [direct download](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/releases/latest). This includes both 32- and 64-bit builds for ARM architectures.

| Operating system     | Debian version | Kernel version  | RaspAP version | Size  |
| ---------------------| ---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) Lite | 12 (bookworm)  | 6.6             | Latest         | 777 MB|
| Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite | 12 (bookworm)  | 6.6             | Latest         | 805 MB|

These images are automatically generated with each release of RaspAP. You may choose between an `arm64` or `armhf` (32-bit) based build. Refer to [this resource](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) to ensure compatibility with your hardware.

After downloading your desired image from the [latest release page](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/releases/latest), use a utility such as the Raspberry Pi Imager or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) to flash the OS image onto a microSD card. Insert the card into your device and boot it up. The latest RaspAP release version with the most popular optional components will be active and ready for you to configure.

### Quick installer
Alternatively, start with a clean install of a [latest release of Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/). Both the 32- and 64-bit release versions are supported, as well as the latest 64-bit Desktop distribution.

Update RPi OS to its latest version, including the kernel and firmware, followed by a reboot:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
Set the WiFi country in raspi-config's **Localisation Options**: `sudo raspi-config`.

Install RaspAP from your device's shell prompt:
```sh
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```

The Quick installer will respond to several [command line arguments](https://docs.raspap.com/quick/), or switches, to customize your installation in a variety of ways, or install one of RaspAP's optional helper tools.

### Initial settings
After completing either of these setup options, the wireless AP network will be configured as follows:

* IP address: 10.3.141.1
  * Username: admin
  * Password: secret
* DHCP range: 10.3.141.50 — 10.3.141.254
* SSID: `raspi-webgui`
* Password: ChangeMe

It's _strongly recommended_ that your first post-install action is to change the default admin [authentication](https://docs.raspap.com/authentication/) settings. Thereafter, your AP's [basic settings](https://docs.raspap.com/ap-basics/) and many [advanced options](https://docs.raspap.com/ap-basics#advanced-options) are now ready to be modified by RaspAP.

Please [read this](https://docs.raspap.com/issues/) before reporting an issue.

## WireGuard support

![](https://i.imgur.com/5YDv37e.png)

WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN, and is generally regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution for modern Linux distributions.

WireGuard may be optionally installed by the [Quick Installer](https://docs.raspap.com/quick/). Once this is done, you can manage local (server) settings, create a peer configuration and control the `wg-quick` service with RaspAP.

Details are [provided here](https://docs.raspap.com/wireguard/).

## OpenVPN support

![](https://i.imgur.com/ta7tCon.png)

OpenVPN may be optionally installed by the Quick Installer. Once this is done, you can [manage client configurations](https://docs.raspap.com/openvpn/) and the `openvpn-client` service with RaspAP.

To configure an OpenVPN client, upload a valid .ovpn file and, optionally, specify your login credentials. RaspAP will store your client configuration and add firewall rules to forward traffic from OpenVPN's `tun0` interface to your configured wireless interface. 

See our [OpenVPN documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/openvpn/) for more information.

## VPN provider support

Several popular VPN providers include a Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with their services. As a new beta feature, you may optionally control these VPN services from within RaspAP. After your provider's CLI is installed on your system you may administer it thereafter by using RaspAP's UI.

See our [VPN provider documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/providers/) for more information.

## Ad Blocking
This feature uses DNS blacklisting to block requests for ads, trackers and other undesirable hosts. To enable ad blocking, simply respond to the prompt during the installation. As a beta release, we encourage testing and feedback from users of RaspAP.

Details are [provided here](https://docs.raspap.com/adblock/).

## Bridged AP
By default RaspAP configures a routed AP for your clients to connect to. A bridged AP configuration is also possible. Slide the **Bridged AP mode** toggle under the **Advanced** tab of **Configure hotspot**, then save and restart the hotspot.

**Note:** In bridged mode, all routing capabilities are handled by your upstream router. Because your router assigns IP addresses to your device's hotspot and its clients, you might not be able to reach the RaspAP web interface from the default `10.3.141.1` address. Instead use your RPi's hostname followed by `.local` to access the RaspAP web interface. With Raspbian default settings, this should look like `raspberrypi.local`. Alternate methods are [discussed here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md).

More information on Bridged AP mode is provided [in our documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/bridged/).

## Manual installation
Detailed manual setup instructions are provided [on our documentation site](https://docs.raspap.com/manual/).

## 802.11ac 5GHz support
RaspAP provides an 802.11ac wireless mode option for supported hardware (currently the RPi 3B+/4 and compatible Orange Pi models) and wireless regulatory domains. See [this](https://docs.raspap.com/ap-basics/#80211ac-5-ghz) for more information.

## Supported operating systems
RaspAP was originally made for Raspbian, but now also installs on the following Debian-based distros.

| Distribution | Release  | Architecture | Support |

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XiAJNKb.png" style="width:480px;" />

You are also encouraged to use RaspAP's community-led [Docker container](#docker-support). Please note that "supported" is not a guarantee. If you are able to improve support for your preferred distro, we encourage you to [actively contribute](#how-to-contribute) to the project.

## HTTPS support
The Quick Installer may be used to [generate SSL certificates](https://docs.raspap.com/ssl-quick/) with `mkcert`. The installer automates the manual steps [described here](https://docs.raspap.com/ssl-manual/), including configuring lighttpd with SSL support. 

Simply append the `-c` or `--cert` option to the Quick Installer, like so:

```sh
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash -s -- --cert
```

**Note**: this only installs mkcert and generates an SSL certificate with the input you provide. It does *not* (re)install RaspAP.

More information on SSL certificates and HTTPS support is available [in our documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/ssl/). 

## Docker support
<img src="https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/assets/229399/dc40dfc4-e9b8-405f-8ffb-6c5f88482b8e" width="450">

As an alternative to the [Quick installer](#quick-installer), RaspAP may be run in an isolated, portable [Docker container](https://docs.raspap.com/docker/).

See the [RaspAP-docker repo](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-docker/) for more information.

## Custom user plugins
RaspAP's integrated `PluginManager` provides a framework for developers to create custom plugins. To facilitate this, a `SamplePlugin` [repository](https://github.com/RaspAP/SamplePlugin) is available to get developers started on the right track. If you'd like to develop your own plugin for RaspAP, see the [documentation](https://docs.raspap.com/custom-plugins/) or get started right away by forking the [SamplePlugin](https://github.com/RaspAP/SamplePlugin).

## Multilingual support
RaspAP uses [GNU Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) to manage multilingual messages. In order to use RaspAP with one of our supported translations, you must configure a corresponding language package on your RPi. To list languages currently installed on your system, use `locale -a` at the shell prompt. To generate new locales, run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` and select any other desired locales. Details are provided on our [documentation site](https://docs.raspap.com/translations/).

See this list of [supported languages](https://docs.raspap.com/translations/#supported-languages) that are actively maintained by volunteer translators. If your language is not supported, why not [contribute a translation](https://docs.raspap.com/translations/#contributing-to-a-translation)? Contributors will receive credit as the original translators.
