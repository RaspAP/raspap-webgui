RaspAP lets you quickly get a WiFi access point up and running to share the internet connectivity of a Raspberry Pi. Our famous [Quick installer](#quick-installer) creates a known-good default configuration that "just works" on all current Raspberry Pis with onboard wireless. A handsome responsive interface gives you control over the relevant services and networking options. OpenVPN client support, SSL, security audits, themes and multilingual options round out the package. 

RaspAP has been featured on sites such as [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-As-Completely-Wireless-Router/), [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/06/24/raspap-wifi-configuration-portal-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/), [Raspberry Pi Weekly](https://www.raspberrypi.org/weekly/commander/) and [Awesome Raspberry Pi](https://project-awesome.org/thibmaek/awesome-raspberry-pi) and implemented in countless projects.

We hope you enjoy using RaspAP as much as we do creating it. Tell us how you use this with [your own Pi-powered projects](https://github.com/billz/raspap-awesome)!

## Prerequisites
Start with a clean install of the [latest release of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (currently Buster). Raspbian Buster Lite is recommended.

1. Update Raspbian, including the kernel and firmware, followed by a reboot:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
2. Set the WiFi country in raspi-config's **Localisation Options**: `sudo raspi-config`

3. If you have a Raspberry Pi without an onboard WiFi chipset, the [**Edimax Wireless 802.11b/g/n nano USB adapter**](https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/global/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un) is an excellent option – it's small, cheap and has good driver support.

With the prerequisites done, you can proceed with either the Quick installer or Manual installation steps below.

## Quick installer
Install RaspAP from your RaspberryPi's shell prompt:
```sh
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash
```
The [installer](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/Quick-Installer-usage) will complete the steps in the manual installation (below) for you.

After the reboot at the end of the installation the wireless network will be
configured as an access point as follows:
* IP address: 10.3.141.1
  * Username: admin
  * Password: secret
* DHCP range: 10.3.141.50 to 10.3.141.255
* SSID: `raspi-webgui`
* Password: ChangeMe

**Note:** As the name suggests, the Quick Installer is a great way to quickly setup a new AP. However, it does not automagically detect the unique configuration of your RPi. Best results are obtained by connecting an RPi to ethernet (`eth0`) or as a WiFi client, also known as managed mode, with `wlan0`. For the latter, refer to [this FAQ](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/FAQs#how-do-i-prepare-the-sd-card-to-connect-to-wifi-in-headless-mode). Please [read this](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/Reporting-issues) before reporting an issue.

## Simultaneous AP and Wifi client
RaspAP lets you easily create an AP with a Wifi client configuration. With your RPi configured in managed mode, enable the AP from the **Advanced** tab of **Configure hotspot** by sliding the **Wifi client AP mode** toggle. Save settings and start the hotspot. The managed mode AP is functional without restart.

**Note:** This option is disabled until you configure your RPi as a wireless client. For a Raspberry Pi operating in [managed mode](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/FAQs#how-do-i-prepare-the-sd-card-to-connect-to-wifi-in-headless-mode) without an `eth0` connection, this configuration must be enabled _before_ a reboot. 

## Support us
RaspAP is free software, but powered by your support. If you find RaspAP useful for your personal or commercial projects, please [become a GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/billz), join the project on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/raspap) or make a one-time donation with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme2/billzgithub). Any of these options makes a big difference!

## Manual installation
Detailed manual setup instructions are provided [on our wiki](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/Manual-installation).

## 802.11ac 5GHz support
RaspAP provides an 802.11ac wireless mode option for supported hardware (currently the RPi 3B+/4) and wireless regulatory domains. See [this FAQ](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/FAQs#80211ac) for more information. 

## Multilingual support
RaspAP uses [GNU Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) to manage multilingual messages. In order to use RaspAP with one of our supported translations, you must configure a corresponding language package on your RPi. To list languages currently installed on your system, use `locale -a` at the shell prompt. To generate new locales, run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` and select any other desired locales. Details are provided on our [wiki](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/Translations#raspap-in-your-language). 

The following translations are currently maintained by the project:

- Deutsch
- Français
- Italiano
- Português
- Svenska
- Nederlands
- 简体中文 (Chinese Simplified)
- Indonesian
- 한국어 (Korean)
- 日本語 (Japanese)
- Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)
- Čeština
- Русский
- Español
- Finnish
- Sinhala
- Türkçe
- ελληνικό (Greek)

If your language is not in the list above, why not [contribute a translation](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/Translations#contributing-a-translation)? Contributors will receive credit as the original translators.

## HTTPS support
The Quick Installer may be used to [generate SSL certificates](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/SSL-certificates-(Quick-Installer)) with `mkcert`. The installer automates the manual steps [described in the wiki](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/SSL-(Manual-steps)), including configuring lighttpd with SSL support. 

Simply append the `-c` or `--cert` option to the Quick Installer, like so:

```sh
curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash -s -- --cert
```

**Note**: this only installs mkcert and generates an SSL certificate with the input you provide. It does *not* (re)install RaspAP.

More information on SSL certificates and HTTPS support is available [on our wiki](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/SSL-certificates-(Quick-Installer)). 

## OpenVPN support
OpenVPN may be optionally installed by the Quick Installer. Once this is done, you can managage a client configuration and the `openvpn-client` service with RaspAP.

To configure an OpenVPN client, upload a valid .ovpn file and, optionally, specify your login credentials. RaspAP will store your client configuration and add firewall rules to forward traffic from OpenVPN's `tun0` interface to your configured wireless interface. 

**Note**: this feature is currently in beta. Please [read this](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/FAQs#-openvpn-fails-to-start-andor-i-have-no-internet-help) before reporting an issue.
