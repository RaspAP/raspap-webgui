ABOUT SUBNET CALCULATOR
The subnet calculator lets you enter a subnet range (CIDR) and see IP address information about that range You can type your range directly in CIDR notation, or use the optional Mask pull-down:

74.125.227.0/29
74.125.227.0, then select Optional Mask from dropdown
This is a useful feature for service providers and network operator who frequently allocate and work with subnets. CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, and refers to the standard of dividing the entire IP address space into smaller networks of variable size.

Thank you for improving the security of our open source software.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to [security@raspap.com](mailto:security@raspap.com). The requested information listed below will help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

1. Type of issue (eg. shell exploit, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
5. Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
6. Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
7. Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. Developers may ask for additional information or clarity on your report.
If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity, but historically within a few days.
