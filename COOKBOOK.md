Wireless networking combines two complex technologies—networking and radio frequencies—making it a challenging yet rewarding area to explore.<br><br>

_[The Wireless Cookbook](https://nostarch.com/wireless-cookbook)_ provides those skills through a hands-on, project-based approach designed for hobbyists, educators, and Linux enthusiasts. This book uses accessible step-by-step recipes to teach readers about Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Long Range (LoRa) technologies through practical, feature-rich projects built with Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers (SBCs).

Each chapter presents a self-contained project, guiding readers from foundational concepts to real-world applications as they gain fluency in Python and essential Linux tools, all while uncovering the capabilities of modern SBCs. 

Unlike theoretical guides, _[The Wireless Cookbook](https://nostarch.com/wireless-cookbook)_ emphasizes functional, customizable projects you can use in daily life or expand into your own creations, providing the knowledge and confidence to experiment with cutting-edge technologies.
  
Covers the fundamentals of the 802.11 wireless (Wi-Fi) protocol, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Long Range (LoRa) wireless, and the LoRaWAN protocol in depth.
